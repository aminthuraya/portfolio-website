          <li>CLIENT</li>
          <p>
            CareerFoundry (Case Study). Diamas was created as part of my UI
            Design course.
          </p>
          <li>OBJECTIVE</li>
          <p>
            CareerFoundry envisioned to make the process easier for consumers
            who are interested in browsing and buying beautiful glamorous
            jewelry to match their particular needs. I wanted to create a
            simple, easy to use, aesthetically pleasing user experience with
            secure uncomplicated payment process.
          </p>
          <li>THE CHALLENGE</li>
          <p>
            There are many e-commerce websites that offer a jewelry shopping
            experience. I have not been able to see many great mobile apps out
            there that offer a clean pleasing UI experience with a simple
            checkout process.
          </p>
          <li>USERS</li>
          <p>
            Anyone who is seeking to find beautiful jewelry, purchase online
            safely and with ease, aimed at both Male and Female, for a memorable
            occasion or a gift for someone special.

        <h2>STYLE GUIDE</h2>
        <p>
          Creating a brand for my app was important as this is how I want the
          app to be perceived in my user’s mind. It sets the feel for the app,
          how I want the user to feel every time they see anything related to
          Diamas. I want the first thing that comes to my user’s mind when they
          hear of Diamas is “Luxury”. Below is a Brand Guidelines documents
          which defines the brand elements like the logo, color, typography,
          iconography and the writing style.

        <h2>USER FLOW DIAGRAM</h2>
        <p>
          After defining my MVP and a task analysis for each of my user stories,
          I compiled these user stories in one user flow diagram to define the
          entry point and the path a user would take to reach their goal.

        <h2>WIREFRAMES</h2>
        <p>
          Low, mid and high-fidelity wireframes were created to visualize my
          design by first sketching with pen and paper and then refined the
          wireframes in Sketch. Wireframes are the communication tool between
          the client and designer and the rest of the team. In this case the
          high-fidelity stage was shared with 10 users for constructive feedback
          which was very welcomed, iterations and adjustments were made before
          diving into the final design.

        <h2>RETROSPECTIVE</h2>
        <p>
          Feedback has been very encouraging for this app. I feel I have
          achieved the goals set out in the brief. The app has an elegant and
          expensive feel and very happy with the colour scheme and choice of
          font to complement the design. I still feel the app could benefit from
          more elements, for example adding videos of the products which show a
          360 degree angle of a ring, this will further entice the customer to
          buy the item. Mixed opinions from test users that maybe an icon added
          next to each category on the home page, this option could be further
          explored in the future. Credits go out to all my test subjects for
          their constructive and valuable feedback as well as my tutor and
          mentor throughout this project.
